                <h3>More About Me</h3>
                <p>
                  I have studied Information Technology but have always been interested in Game development. I was 16 years old when I made my first Game with unity. While I was studying in the university I took computer science  as my major subject and was introduced to programming. During my studies I was an active member in student associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects including being a Game Developer. That and my previous interest in game development created a spark to turn my hobby into a career. I took my first steps towards my new career in January 2022.

                <p>
                  I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or animating.
